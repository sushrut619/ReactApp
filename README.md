I built this app as a way to learn React. This app simulates a doctor's appointment portal. The user can add appointments, update appointment date and time and also delete appointment.

The react app consumes the REST API implemented using Nodejs. The Nodejs backend server is responsible for interacting with the MySQL databsase. Some basic data validation is also implemented in the front end.
